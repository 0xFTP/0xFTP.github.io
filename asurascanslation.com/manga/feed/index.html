										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Who am I?” </p>
<p>The legend of the French Foreign Legion, ‘Kang Chan’! During the African war, he was called ‘God of Blackfield’, the black land’s God, by his enemies who were terrified but in awe of him. However, during a mission to kill Masallan, the brain behind SISS, the group of sunni supporters, Kang Chan was killed in action by an unknown bullet shot from behind him. As his vision got blurry, he saw his thirteen team members, who had absolute faith in him, getting killed one after another. As Kang Chan was awaiting death after being shot by a traitor, he was saved by a mysterious power and woke up 3 years later in South Korea. However, he was in the body of another ‘Kang Chan’, a 19-year-old high school boy who was being bullied at school. Kang Chan’s journey to get revenge on the traitor and to find out the truth behind his rebirth begins now!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BASED ON THE HIT NOVEL ON TAPAS!</p>
<p>King Grey has unrivaled strength, wealth, and prestige in a world governed by martial ability. However, solitude lingers closely behind those with great power. Beneath the glamorous exterior of a powerful king lurks the shell of man, devoid of purpose and will.</p>
<p>Reincarnated into a new world filled with magic and monsters, the king has a second chance to relive his life. Correcting the mistakes of his past will not be his only challenge, however. Underneath the peace and prosperity of the new world is an undercurrent threatening to destroy everything he has worked for, questioning his role and reason for being born again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I was a noble this whole time?!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hilde, a commoner who works at a restaurant in the village, is suddenly notified by a handsome man named Logan that she is a family member of one of the empire&#8217;s four duchies and hears that her mother &#8216;Lucia Arpeggio&#8217; was a powerful mage in the past.</p>
<p>Duke Arpeggio offers to make her an official member of the family if she can prove that she has strong magical powers, and Hilde accepts in order to escape from her oppressed commoner livelihood and enjoy a comfortable life.</p>
<p>However, her excitement doesn&#8217;t last long… Culture, magic, history, literature, etc. The number of things nobles needed to learn were endless! In addition, forget about welcoming Hilde, her family members only sent her cold looks and even put her life in danger…</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve left me with no choice. I, a former commoner, will be taking over this duchy!&#8221;</p>
